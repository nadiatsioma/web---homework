      <i>Flush A Biography by Virginia Woolf</i>
      <br /><br />
      It is universally admitted that the family from which the subject of this
      memoir claims descent is one of the greatest antiquity. Therefore it is
      not strange that the origin of the name itself is lost in obscurity. Many
      million years ago the country which is now called Spain seethed uneasily
      in the ferment of creation. Ages passed; vegetation appeared; where there
      is vegetation the law of Nature has decreed that there shall be rabbits;
      where there are rabbits, Providence has ordained there shall be dogs.
      There is nothing in this that calls for question, or comment. But when we
      ask why the dog that caught the rabbit was called a Spaniel, then doubts
      and difficulties begin. Some historians say that when the Carthaginians
      landed in Spain the common soldiers shouted with one accord "Span!
      Span!"—for rabbits darted from every scrub, from every bush. The land was
      alive with rabbits. And Span in the Carthaginian tongue signifies Rabbit.
      Thus the land was called Hispania, or Rabbit-land, and the dogs, which
      were almost instantly perceived in full pursuit of the rabbits, were
      called Spaniels or rabbit dogs. <br /><br />
      There many of us would be content to let the matter rest; but truth
      compels us to add that there is another school of thought which thinks
      differently. The word Hispania, these scholars say, has nothing whatever
      to do with the Carthaginian word span. Hispania derives from the Basque
      word españa, signifying an edge or boundary. If that is so, rabbits,
      bushes, dogs, soldiers—the whole of that romantic and pleasant picture,
      must be dismissed from the mind; and we must simply suppose that the
      Spaniel is called a spaniel because Spain is called España. As for the
      third school of antiquaries which maintains that just as a lover calls his
      mistress monster or monkey, so the Spaniards called their favourite dogs
      crooked or cragged (the word españa can be made to take these meanings)
      because a spaniel is notoriously the opposite—that is too fanciful a
      conjecture to be seriously entertained.
